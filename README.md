# Full CRUD full stack App

- Use Express to build a server
- Use Mongoose to communicate with MongoDB
- Full CRUD functionality on our fruits resource
- User Authentication
- The ability to add comments to fruits
- (Maybe gather data from a 3rd party API)

This app will start as an API, that receives requests and sendd JSON response, but eventually we will add a view layer that will render html in our browser

This an MVC application
We're using the MVC system for organizing our code.
This breaks down our code into 3 parts
MVC stands for 
-Models
-Views
-Controllers

Models- All of our data, what shape it's in and what resource we're using(models), and how our resources relate to one another.

Views- All the different ways we can see our data, whether it's as a JSON response, or an actual HTML response, this determines how our data can be viewed by others.

Controllers -
